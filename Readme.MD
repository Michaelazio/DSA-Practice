# DSA Practice with JavaScript

Welcome to my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) practice project. This repository showcases my understanding and implementation of various DSAs using JavaScript. The primary purpose of this project is educational, aimed at portraying my knowledge and skills in this domain.

## Project Structure

The project consists of a single HTML file and several JavaScript files, each dedicated to a specific data structure or algorithm.

### Files

- **index.html**: The main HTML file that links to the various JavaScript files. This file serves as the entry point for the project.
- **algorithms**: A directory containing individual JavaScript files, each implementing a specific data structure or algorithm.

### JavaScript Files

Each JavaScript file in the `algorithms` directory focuses on a particular DSA. Below is a list of some of the DSAs included in this project:


- `SinglyLinkedList.js`: Implementation of a Singly Linked List.
- `PriorityQueue.js`: Implementation of a Priority Queue.
- `HashTable.js`: Implementation of a Hash Table.
- `Graph.js`: Implementation of a Graph.
- `DoublyLInkedLIst.js` : Implementation of a Doubly LInked LIst.
## Getting Started

To view and test the implementations, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/dsa-practice-js.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd dsa-practice-js
    ```
3. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to view the implementations:
    ```sh
    open index.html
    ```

## Usage

This project is intended for educational purposes. Feel free to explore the implementations, run the code, and modify it to deepen your understanding of DSAs.
